A guide to set up EpisodicRAG as quickly as possible and verify it works.

---

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code or Claude VSCode Extension installed
- Python 3.x installed

---

## Step 1: Installation (1 min)

### 1-1. Add Marketplace

```bash
/marketplace add https://github.com/Bizuayeu/Plugins-Weave
```

### 1-2. Install Plugin

```bash
/plugin install EpisodicRAG-Plugin@Plugins-Weave
```

---

## Step 2: Setup (1 min)

```bash
@digest-setup
```

Select **[1] (default)** for all questions:

```text
Q1: Loop file location → [1] Inside Plugin (self-contained)
Q2: Digest file output → [1] Inside Plugin (self-contained)
Q3: Essences file location → [1] Inside Plugin (self-contained)
Q4: External Identity.md file → [1] Don't use
Q5-Q12: Threshold for each layer → [1] Default value
```

Confirm the setup completion message:

```text
Setup complete!

Created files:
  - config.json
  - GrandDigest.txt
  - ShadowGrandDigest.txt
```

---

## Step 3: Create Sample Loop (2 min)

### 3-1. Create a Loop File

Create a file with the following content:

**Filename**: `Loop0001_TestConversation.txt`

**Location**: `~/.claude/plugins/EpisodicRAG-Plugin@Plugins-Weave/data/Loops/`

**Content** (copy-paste ready):

```text
# Loop0001: Test Conversation

User: Hello, this is a test for EpisodicRAG.
Assistant: Hello! This is a test for EpisodicRAG. How can I help you?
User: Tell me about the memory system.
Assistant: EpisodicRAG is an 8-layer long-term memory system. It saves conversations as Loop files and manages long-term memory by hierarchically digesting them.
```

---

## Step 4: Run Initial Analysis (1 min)

```bash
/digest
```

**Expected output**:

```text
Unprocessed Loop files detected: 1

  - Loop0001_TestConversation.txt

Starting analysis with DigestAnalyzer...

Analysis complete!
ShadowGrandDigest.txt has been updated
```

---

## Success Checklist

Please verify the following:

- [ ] `@digest-setup` completed successfully
- [ ] Loop file is placed in `data/Loops/`
- [ ] `/digest` detected the unprocessed Loop
- [ ] `ShadowGrandDigest.txt` was updated

If all items are checked, setup is complete!

## Next Steps

### Check System Status

```bash
@digest-auto
```

This displays the current status and recommended actions.

### Generate Weekly Digest After 5 Loops

```bash
# After adding 5 Loop files
/digest weekly
```

1. Check system status with `@digest-auto`
2. Refer to [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
3. Check detailed usage in [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md)
